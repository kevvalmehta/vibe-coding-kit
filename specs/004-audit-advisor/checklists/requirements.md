# Specification Quality Checklist: Audit Advisor (`/audit`)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- Validation passed on first iteration. The spec names existing kit skills (`/safe-change`,
  `/autopilot`, `/speckit-specify`, `/health`, `/guide`, `git-safety`) by role, not as implementation
  detail — they are the product boundary, consistent with how 003-agent-architect references
  `grill-me` and `idea-to-app`.
- One design choice borrows from the external `shadcn/improve` skill; recorded as an assumption, not a
  dependency on installing it (native rebuild).
